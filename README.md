# Machine learning mentoring program at Stuart Delivery

## First assesment 

Having free access to Udemy courses as a Stuart's employee and considering I have experience with python and data processing, my first objective was to complete Sections 6, 7 and 8 from [https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/) course.

#### Section6: Simple linear regression
	
implemented a model to predict the salary of an employee based on his years of experience 

#### Section7: Multiple linear regression

implemented a model to predict the profits of a startup in New York, California or Florida
based on its expenses on R&D, marketing and administration

#### Section8: Polynomial linear regression

implemented a model to predict the salary of an employee depending of its position and the 	
years on rank

## Second assesment

Complete sections 9, 10 and 11 from the Udemy course [https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/)

#### Section9: Support Vector Regression

This one didnt look like a good one to me. Didnt really liked it, still went trought and implemented the model

#### Section10: Decision Tree Regression

Implemented the model which lookes like a simple yet useful model
