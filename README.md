# Machine learning mentoring program at Stuart Delivery

My first introduction with my mentor was awesome, he introduced me to the field from a professional point of view. 

## First assesment 

Having free access to Udemy courses as a Stuart's employee and considering I have experience with python and data processing, my first objective was to complete Sections 6, 7 and 8 from [https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/) course.

#### Section6: Simple linear regression
	
implemented a model to predict the salary of an employee based on his years of experience 

#### Section7: Multiple linear regression

implemented a model to predict the profits of a startup in New York, California or Florida
based on its expenses on R&D, marketing and administration

#### Section8: Polynomial linear regression

implemented a model to predict the salary of an employee depending of its position and the 	
years on rank
